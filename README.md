# Console Blackjack
<b>A simple console based Blackjack game, created in Visual Studio using C#.</b>

The player competes against a computerized "House" player in a game of tradtional Blackjack. The program emulates a 52 card deck, with random shuffling occuring after the entire deck has been played. As is the case with most casino house players, the computer will stop asking for hitting after attaining a score of 17 or more.

The standard rules for Blackjack can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack).
